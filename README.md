Tools for the knowledge-based analysis of human activities, currently
consisting of the following packages:

  * mod_ham is a collection of methods for representing and creating
    Hiearchical Action Models (HAM). See beetz09ameva for details on these models.
  * comp_fipm is a wrapper around the (legacy) tool FIPM developed at the IAS
